## What you need
A [kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/philibertc/pellet-heater-controller/) or:
- An ESP8266 (I recommend the D1 Mini). (approx. 5€)
- 3 PC817. (less than 4€ for 10pcs)
- 3 510 Ohms resistors. (less than 2€ for 100pcs)
- That's all!

## The circuit
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57588282/128608590-39b0e0ff-b224-42bd-bb20-524a78f282f6.png)

`Enable_RX` is D2 (GPIO4) on ESP8266 or GPIO35 on ESP32.  
`RX` is D3 (GPIO0) on ESP8266 or GPIO32 on ESP32.  
`TX` is D4 (GPIO2) on ESP8266 or GPIO33 on ESP32.

The optocouplers are used to convert between 3.3V and 5V logic and also to protect the pellet stove and the ESP from each other in case of problem.

## Stove's mainboard pinout
There is a 4 pin connector (CN13 or SERIALE) with 5V, 20V, Serial, GND:

## MicroNova protocol
Explained [here](https://ridiculouslab.altervista.org/en/micronova-protocol-converter/) under "Micronova protocol".

## Uploading firmware
### With Arduino IDE
- Install ESP cards with the board manager (custom URLs: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`)
- Install WifiManager, PubSubClient and ArduinoOTA libraries
- Copy the content of `micronova_controller.ino`
- Edit the first 6 lines (see below)
- Connect your ESP to your computer and flash
- You will be able to update the firmware using the network port (with password micronova)

## Parameters to be modified before compilation
The first six lines (with #define) must be edited:
- Optionally adapt `mqtt_port` if you aren't using 1883
- Optionally adapt `mqtt_topic` if you have multiple stoves
- Setup `mqtt_user` and `mqtt_pass` (leave "" if you don't have credentials)
- Optionally set `hydro_mode` from `0` to `1` if your pellet stove has the boiler feature

## Configure WiFi and the MQTT broker URL
- Connect to the `micronova` WiFi network
- Go to 192.168.4.1
- Setup your WiFi credentials

## MQTT details
First of all, if you use Home Assistant read [this paragraph](#home-assistant).
### The different topics
- The `mqtt_topic`, it's the common part between all the topics (default: `micronova`).
- The `pong_topic`, message "Powered up" sent every 25 seconds (`mqtt_topic`**`/pong`**).
- The `state_topic`, this is the topic containing the detailed status of the stove (`mqtt_topic`**`/state`**).
- The `onoff_topic`, this is the topic informing if the stove is turned off or on (`mqtt_topic`**`/onoff`**).
- The `ambtemp_topic`, this is the topic where you can read the ambient temperature (`mqtt_topic`**`/ambtemp`**).
- The `tempset_topic` (not yet working), this is the topic on which you can read the requested air temperature (`mqtt_topic`**`/tempset`**)
- The `fumetemp_topic`, this is the topic on which you can read the temperature of the fumes (`mqtt_topic`**`/fumetemp`**).
- The `flame_topic`, this is the topic on which you can read the power of the flame (in percent) (`mqtt_topic`**`/flamepower`**).
- The `watertemp_topic`, this is the topic on which you can read the water temperature (only if you have a hydro pellet stove) (`mqtt_topic`**`/watertemp`**).
- The `waterset_topic` (not yet working), this is the topic on which you can read the requested water temperature (only if you have a hydro pellet stove) (`mqtt_topic`**`/waterset`**).
- The `waterpres_topic`, this is the topic on which you can read the water pressure in bars (only if you have a hydro pellet stove) (`mqtt_topic`**`/waterpres`**).
- The `in_topic`, it is the topic allowing to control the stove (`mqtt_topic`**`/intopic`**).

### Controlling the stove
- To light the stove send `ON` to `in_topic`, __without retain flag__.
- To turn off the stove send `OFF` to `in_topic`, with or without retain flag.
- To force extinction of the stove send `force` to `in_topic`, __without retain flag__.
- To put the ESP into deep sleep send `Sleep` to `in_topic`, with retain flag.
- To wake up the ESP send `Wake` to `in_topic`, with retain flag. (When the ESP is in deep sleep, it wakes up every 5 minutes to check if the `Wake` message has been received.)

## Reset all settings
If you want to reset all the settings here is what you can do:
- send `reset` to `in_topic` or
- connect the `RESET_PIN` (D5 (GPIO14) on ESP8266 or GPIO25 on ESP32) to GND (this is not the RST pin of the ESP) or
- `esptool erase_flash` but this will also delete the program.
## Home Assistant
Here is what to add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: ""    #E.g. "Living room"
    state_topic: "mqtt_topic/onoff"    #You have to edit that
    command_topic: "mqtt_topic/intopic"    #Also that
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    state_on: "ON"
    state_off: "OFF"
    retain: false
    optimistic: false
    qos: 0
    icon: mdi:fire
```

```yaml

  - platform: mqtt
